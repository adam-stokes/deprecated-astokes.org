I decided to go out and get me a xbox 360 this weekend and after 2 exchanges and a tank of gas I am finally enjoying it.Why 2 exchanges? Well thanks to either a bad shipment, certain models, or just Microsoft being gay(second meaning) the HDD was bad. The HDD continued to suck ass until I finally went to another Best Buy and exchanged it for a 3rd and hopefully final time.Anyway, once the xbox started and got going it is pretty h4wt. I purchased Gears of War because of all the good things I heard about it and to me they were all true. GoW is a definate purchase for any FPS fan.I haven't had a chance to look into Arcade or any of the other marketplace items available to me so I'm not sure if I download a HD movie if I have it for life or if its a one time download and once it is removed from your HDD thats it?I plan on picking up Fight Night 3, Madden 07, and possibly Rainbow Six : Vegas or Lost Planet :)

Well don't feel bad I've only got a small window of playing time as the wife doesn't allow me to play while the baby is awake :)


Willow Creek Homeowner Association

I want one too.  I haven't gotten it yet becase I built a new house last year and I have to landscape, pour a driveway and I really can't afford any of that either.  So bottom line is, I am stuck reading blogs while you play awesome games.
