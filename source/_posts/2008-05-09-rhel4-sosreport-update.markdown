Just finished updating sosreport for RHEL4 :An updated sos package that fixes a serious bug and adds two enhancementsis now available.  Sos is a set of tools that gathers information about system hardware andconfiguration. The information can then be used for diagnostic purposes anddebugging. Sos is commonly used to help support technicians and developers.Please see the errata release for more information.There was also one released a few weeks back that addressed the serious bug where tricking sosreport into running a `rm -rf /` on the filesystem. OOPSIE!
