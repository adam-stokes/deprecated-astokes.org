[![endorse](http://api.coderwall.com/battlemidget/endorsecount.png)](http://coderwall.com/battlemidget)

Currently, a sustaining engineer for Canonical, Ltd. We maintain
current releases of Ubuntu with a heavier focus on LTS releases. A lot
of my work tends to go on in the background with fixing bugs, getting
new features in, and overall providing a helping hand to the
engineering team. It is my goal to be one of the go-to guys when it
comes to customer satisfaction with our current supported products. I
deal with the engineers in the userspace realm and occasionally
dabble in kernel space.

I enjoy programming in all different languages but I'm well versed in:

* Python
* Perl
* C
* Shell

Hobby languages:

* LISP dialects
  + ANSICL
  + SBCL
  + CMUCL
  + Clojure
* Go
* Dart
* Javascript
* Ruby

## Projects and Contributions ##

### Canonical Related  ###

My public facing work with Canonical located at:

[Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/~adam-stokes)

You can find the nitty gritty of the details at:

[Launchpad code](https://code.launchpad.net/~adam-stokes)

A list of package maintenance I'm involved in:

[Uploaded Packages to main distribution](https://launchpad.net/~adam-stokes/+uploaded-packages)

### Previous work and projects  ###
Before Canonical, I worked for 7 years at Red Hat, Inc. where I
started from the bottom of the totem pole and finally ended my stay
with them in their Engineering R&D for Virtualization technologies. My
last project with them was **Matahari**, which was basically systems
management and monitoring for the cloud.

[Github:Matahari](https://github.com/matahari/matahari)

I also wrote **CAS** (core analysis system) which provided support
engineers with an automated way to take a kernel core dump and have a
system provisioned and setup for the engineering team to analyze.

[CAS Project](https://fedorahosted.org/cas/)

I was also a maintainer and still heavily involved with **sosreport**.
Which is basically a system's data collector for helping engineers get
a peek at a clients system in order to help further troubleshoot or
reproduce an issue.

### Contributions ###

[sosreport](https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport)

Since working with Canonical I've done a lot of Debian/Ubuntu specific
work for sosreport in order to have proper packaging and make
sosreport's gathering routines applicable on those distributions. I've
got a ppa setup for it:

[Ubuntu PPA for sosreport](https://launchpad.net/~debugmonkeys/+archive/sosreport)

[django-sslserver](https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver/commits?author=battlemidget)

Run development django servers with ssl support.

### Other smaller projects ###

[Python-salesforce](http://python.salesforce.astokes.org)

A python client and authorization library for interfacing with Salesforce
RESTful API.

[Net::OAuth::LP](http://net.oauth.lp.astokes.org)

A perl library for interfacing with https://api.launchpad.net over OAuth 1.0.

[DTW::Harness](http://dtw.harness.astokes.org)

Functional, Acceptance, and Unit test harness for bug resolutions.

[Kelp::Module::MongoDB](http://kelp.module.mongodb.astokes.org/)

Interface with MongoDB through [Kelp](https://metacpan.org/release/Kelp)

[Other CPAN related modules](https://metacpan.org/author/ADAMJS)

[Firefox Collection - shakeNbake](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/battlemidget/shakenbake/)

Firefox addons I've found useful.

### Technologies I'm interested in ###
The userspace is a big realm and there are a range of different
technologies that it can become difficult to specialize in
everything. Here are some of the technologies I've researched and
hacked on more than others:

* System Administration
  + Account management/authentication
    + LDAP
    + Kerberos
  + Filesystem
    + NFS
    + autofs
  + Clustering/Load balancing
  + Security
    + Apparmor
    + SELinux
    + System hardening
  + Databases
    + postgres
    + mysql
    + mongo
    + sqlite
    + redis
  + Automation
    + Puppet
    + Chef
    + Kickstart
    + Preseed
    + PXE
  + Cloud
    + Openstack
    + Rackspace
    + Juju
    + AWS
    + Maas
    + Linode
* KVM userspace (virt-manager, qemu)
* GNOME/glib
* QT/QML
* Multi-architecture support (arm, x86, x86_64)
* Messaging
  + rabbitmq
  + amqp
  + qpid

I read any chance I have and am a big fan of apocalyptic, zombies, and espionage thrillers.

## In closing  ##
  
Finally, throughout my journey in the opensource community, handling
the balance of both community and paying customers I have been lucky
enough to experience both ends of the spectrum and everything in
between. From my experience I've accomplished roles from frontline support
calls, customer on-site visits, sustaining engineering, and
engineering.

I am intimately familiar with processes from both Red Hat and
Canonical. I've been fortunate enough to have had my contributions
utilized in the progression of an idea to product launch. My understanding
of procedures for customer satisfaction, setting
expectations, and providing insightful education to my peers are
exceptional and increasing every day.

I am a firm believer in getting what you paid for and the value of
customer relationship. Every day I strive to exceed excellence and
always on the lookout for productive ways to solve problems quicker in
order to provide the highest customer satisfaction.
